                    needs, delivering food, taking the sick to hospitals, and delivering the message
                    of love from you. As the need for help, love, and support increases day by day, they have been working tirelessly to ensure that those needs are met.

                        Sokheng is eight years old. He lives with his younger brother and parents. Usually, his parents grow corn and other crops on their farm to eat and sell.  But this year due to the drought they have given up on their farm and now survive by catching fish and picking leaves along the river. The entire family also spends almost all day at the river digging for precious gems.  If they are lucky they may find one piece of ruby to sell for $300 but like many other diggers they may dig all year  and not find anything. They clearly do not have enough to eat, and are struggling to make ends meet.

                        Vann is a 53-year old farmer. Because of the drought, he started to hunt for wild pigs, deer, and porcupines at night. Three weeks before our teachers found him, he had stepped on a landmine and lost his right foot while hunting. He told our teachers that, after stepping on the landmine, he crawled all night until he was discovered by a neighbor. The neighbor told us that when he found Vann crawling, Vann was holding on to an axe because there were tigers in the area. Vann has two children and a wife who will soon give birth to their third child.

                        Piseth is a seven-year old boy. Last year, his father was travelling on a cart that lost its balance and flipped over. His father died.  His mother then ran away. Piseth now lives with his grandparents.The grandmother normally supports the family by picking and selling leaves but with the drought, there are no leaves to sell. She now goes door-to-door to neighbors' houses to help clean dishes in exchange for food.</p>

                        Sophea is a 14-year-old girl who attends TASSEL, together with her 18-year old brother Daruk. Their parents used to live two hours away near the Thai border and travel illegally into Thailand daily to earn income as fruit pickers. However, with the border closing due to COVID, both parents lost their jobs and are back in their village, living with Sophea, Daruk and their grandmother. Daruk found a job as a cart-loading laborer but his $60/month income is not enough to support a family of five.

                        Sina is a 14-year old TASSEL student who lives with her mother, cousin, grandmother and 10-year old cousin. Her father abandoned the family before Sina was born. The family lives in a rental room where they pay $12.50/month to their landlord. Sina's mother used to earn money by playing a Khmer musical instrument during the wedding season and working in restaurants during the off-season, but lost both jobs due to the pandemic. They are in great distress as a result of their financial instability.

The family lives near a town where Chantha's parents are employed at a restaurant: her mother as a dishwasher, and her father as a security guard. Both parents’ jobs were reduced to half-time due to COVID-19, cutting their combined income to $100/month. This is not enough to enable the family of five to survive.

                        Grandpa Komsot is 71 and lives with his wife, Grandma Sreynich. Grandma Sreynich has a mental disorder. In 1985, while working as a woodcutter in the mountains, Grandpa Komsot stepped on a landmine and lost his left foot. They have three sons who are all poor. The eldest used to send $15/month but can no longer help due to COVID-19. The second son is disabled after falling from the second floor as a construction worker and has not been able to support them. The third son has run away from debt collectors and has not been able to help his parents either. Grandma Sreynich used to earn $4/month by picking and selling recyclable cans and bottles, but with COVID-19, the Thai border has closed and the recyclables cannot be sold. Other villagers pity them and have been helping them, but the villagers are also in trouble due to COVID-19 and the drought.

                        Dary (13) and brother Dara (15) are strong students at TASSEL. They, along with four other siblings, are supported by parents who sell incense at the local pagoda. However, due to COVID-19, most worshippers stopped attending the pagoda and their parents' income has dropped dramatically. The father now travels on a very old motorcycle to other villages and sometimes even to other provinces to find people to buy the incense. Despite this, their income is still down by 70%, and they do not have enough to feed their family of eight.

                        Sreyna is 7. Her father was a construction worker in Thailand but lost his job due to the border closing after the virus outbreak. Her mother picked and sold leaves but due to the drought, she has not been able to generate enough income. Sreyna, her parents, and her six siblings do not have enough. The mother was crying when our teachers found them.

                        Sovath is 53 years old. He and his wife have five children aged 4, 6, 10, 13, and 15. They earn $90/month finding firewood in the forest to sell. Now with COVID-19 and the drought, finding and selling firewood have become more competitive. Sovath and his wife now must go into areas where others won't go––areas where the landmines have not yet been cleared. Most do not go into such areas because of the obvious dangers, but Sovath and his wife say that they must go to avoid starvation.

                        Reaksa is ten years old. He is often sick and the parents sold the family land so that he can get medical help. His 16-year old sister was a laborer in Thailand but because of COVID-19, the border has closed and she is now back, unemployed, and lives with the rest of the family. Reaksa lives also with a 12-year old sister, an 8-year old sister, an 81-year old grandmother, and his parents. The parents are farmers but with the drought, they have almost no income. On the day our teachers met this family, Reaksa had just found some bees. He and his family had never caught bees before but were happy that they had found something to eat.

                        Vicheka is a twelve year old boy. He has two older sisters aged 14 and 17. Vicheka's parents are sick so the older sisters earn money for the family by cutting grass and harvesting cassavas for others.. The sisters' combined income was $60/month, but with COVID-19 and the drought, their income is now almost zero. They live in a house on their neighbor's land. The house has no walls and no protection from the rain, sun and wind. They are surviving by finding leaves to eat.

                        Paneth lives with his younger brother and parents in the forest. Because his family has always been poor, he has been working since he was small and although he is 13, he is still in the 3rd grade. Due to COVID-19, his parents lost their jobs as mango pickers following the closure of the Thai mango market. Three days before our teachers found this family, the parents were in the forest trying to find mushrooms to eat. Paneth was at an abandoned mango farm picking manoges for his younger brother when a cobra bit him. A neighbor saw this and killed the cobra. Although three days had passed since the incident, the family did not have the $20 to transport him to a city hospital so Paneth was still untreated.  Our teachers found and paid for transportation to bring him to a city hospital four hours away where he was then hospitalized and treated. He has since been discharged and is now healthy, but the family still does not have enough food.

He now lives with his 55 year old grandaunt who has a small shop, but because of COVID-19 she earns only $1/day. Kakada's older brother was a factory worker in Thailand and used to send $40/month to support Kakada and his grandaunt. However, due to the virus outbreak, the brother lost his job and is unable to send any money. Kakada’s older, married sister is also poor and cannot help as she is already struggling to support her own family.

                            The Cambodian government closes schools and prohibits most gatherings. Travel is also restricted as COVID-19 cases rise.

    Many TASSEL family wage-earners lose their jobs because of border closures, and students cannot continue their education due to a lack of resources (eg. wifi, computers, etc.).

    As of now, the government plans to reopen in November, but there is no education available for poor students in the meantime.

By early July, 45,000 tourist sector workers are unemployed. Cambodia's economy relies on international tourism, and the predicted loss of USD 3 billion by the end of this year projects disastrous prospects for the country's near future.

150,000 factory workers are affected by the closure of 400+ retail factories. 

Farmers are forced to take out loans to make ends meet, leaving many with huge debts they cannot repay.

                        Our teachers were also alerted to struggling families in their own hometowns. Approximately 2000 out of the 3000 families visited were in dire need of emergency aid.  Because of your support, TASSEL was able to provide food and care for every single one of them over the summer.  However, the drought and pandemic are not yet over.
